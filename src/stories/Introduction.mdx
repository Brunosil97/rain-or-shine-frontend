# Welcome to Our Storybook

## What is Storybook?

Storybook is an open-source tool for constructing and displaying UI components and pages in isolation. It serves as a component library where we can view, test, and document components independently, without needing to run the full application. This approach is especially helpful in larger projects where components are reused across multiple pages and features.

Using Storybook helps us to:
- Visualise each component in isolation.
- Interactively test component properties, states, and styling.
- Develop and design components more efficiently.
- Test components for different scenarios, ensuring consistency and reliability across the project.

## Purpose of Storybook in This Project

In our project, Storybook functions as a **visual testing environment** for our reusable Vue and Vuetify components. Since Storybook supports dynamic interactions, we can test and refine components according to design specifications and user requirements before incorporating them into the application. This process reduces the likelihood of UI bugs and inconsistencies.

## Getting Started with Storybook

To view this Storybook, start the development server and explore the components interactively. Each component is accompanied by documentation for its properties, events, and other details useful for development and debugging.

### Running Storybook

To run Storybook locally:
```bash
